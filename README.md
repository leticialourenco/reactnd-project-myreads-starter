# React Fundamentals - MyReads

This is the final project for the React Fundamentals module of Udacity's React Nanodegree.
The app is a multiple bookshelf library that allows for search and archiving of books into the following categories:

* currently reading
* want to read
* read

The user is able to change the status of any book at any given time, add new ones through the search page and remove any items from their shelves.

## Get up and running

* have [node package manager](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* the app will be running on `http://localhost:3000`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
